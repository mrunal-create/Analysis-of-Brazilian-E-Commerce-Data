# Analysis-of-Brazilian-E-Commerce-Data

he Brazilian E-Commerce dataset, provided by OList Store, consists of data on about 100K orders
placed from 2016-2018 at various marketplaces. The data was provided by OList, the largest department
store in Brazilian marketplaces.The dataset allows us to view the order details from multiple dimensions:
from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and
finally reviews written by customers.
The data is divided into multiple datasets including customers dataset, which has information about
customers and location. It also contains the order items dataset which has information about the items
that were placed in a single order, which can have multiple items. Each item order is fulfilled by a distinct
seller. The order payments dataset contains information about payment options and amount.The reviews
dataset has information about customer reviews and ratings.The orders dataset consists of information
related to order delivery time.The products dataset has information about products sold by OList.
As part of this project, we aim to understand the customer market better by performing customer
segmentation on the basis of RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) metrics. Additionally, we conduct
market basket analysis in order to better understand the consumer behavior based on the kind of
products that are frequently purchased together. We plan to identify the frequency of orders placed and
analyze it with day of week, month of year and season. The result is used to reveal the consumer
behavior for the season with maximum orders. Along with this, we intend to estimate the products'
delivery times based on the region of the buyer and seller. Delivery estimates are then visualized on a
map. Text analysis is performed on user comments to gauge public opinion on purchases.
